    <summary>About Regular Expressions in Obtainium</summary>

Regular expressions are used in Obtainium to filter applications in releases, which is especially useful when multiple APKs are available in a release.

**Q: What are regular expressions?**

**A:** Regular expressions allow you to specify patterns to filter applications. This is particularly helpful when a release contains multiple applications:

  <img src=".github/Installation/30.png">

In this example, there are two applications: `yt-extended` and `music-extended`.
If you use `yt-extended` as the regular expression, Obtainium will suggest all applications that match this pattern. Alternatively, it will automatically select and download `yt-extended` without prompting you during each release. By enabling **"Invert regular expression"**, it will suggest all applications that **do not** contain `yt-extended` in their name. In this case, `music-extended` will be the default selection.

However, avoid using the application version as a regular expression because, with updates, the specific version may no longer be available.

More information here: [Obtainium Wiki](https://wiki.obtainium.imranr.dev/) .

Aside from regular expressions, Obtainium simplifies installation, checks for updates at regular intervals (based on your settings), and sends notifications when updates are available for your apps. You can also use it in combination with Shizuku to automate update installations. Note that if there are multiple releases, automatic installation may not occur.
