# <p align="center"> What is ReVanced ? 

RV, short for **R**e**V**anced, and **RVX**, for **R**e**V**anced e**X**tended, are modified versions of YT and YT Music apps that allow you to add many features not available natively, such as SponsorBlock (which skips sponsored content, intros, outros, and more) or Return YT Dislikes (which restores the dislike counter on videos, making it easier to assess video quality). Other functions include hiding ads, hiding Shorts, removing the create button, changing the home page, and much more. All of these features can be toggled on or off, allowing you to customize your app experience.

# <p align="center"> History of ReVanced: 

YT Vanced was an app that allowed users to enjoy some features of YT Premium, such as an ad blocker, Picture-in-Picture, and extra features like SponsorBlock and, since the last update, Return YT Dislikes (RYD). However, on March 13, 2022, the Vanced team announced the end of support for YT Vanced after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Google. For several weeks, many users wondered how they would continue to enjoy its useful features. Team Vanced later confirmed on Twitter that the app would still work for two more years before becoming obsolete (today, the app no longer works).

A few days later (March 21, 2022), after announcing the end of Vanced, ReVanced began developing similar functions and made them open-source, allowing users to apply patches themselves. The issue with Team Vanced was that modifying an app for personal use is legal, but sharing it is not. This was the mistake Team Vanced made. The ingenuity of its successor, ReVanced, is that it gives us control over which patches to apply, without offering pre-patched apps for download, ensuring the project remains legal.

After much hard work, ReVanced released its first version on June 5, 2022, and soon offered patches for YT Music. Later, ReVanced expanded by offering patches for other apps. Currently, YT Vanced is no longer functional or secure, making ReVanced the better alternative: it's as feature-complete as Vanced, but works with the latest versions of YT and, being open-source, is even safer to use than YT Vanced.

# <p align="center"> As for Extended: 

Inotia00 had already proposed additional features to enhance Vanced ([Vanced Extended](https://t.me/vanced_mod_archive)), offering apps via Telegram. After Vanced development stopped and ReVanced emerged, Inotia00 adapted his code to make it open-source based on the ReVanced repository.

ReVanced Extended offers more comprehensive patches but focuses solely on YT, YT Music, and more recently, Reddit. It provides all the features of Vanced, plus additional functions tailored to current expectations of new YT features. While its community is smaller than ReVanced's, Inotia00 has opened a Crowdin for the community to help translate YT Extended and YT Music Extended into different languages, ensuring added settings are translated, just like with Vanced.

I thank [Vanced team](https://github.com/TeamVanced) for creating YT Vanced and Vanced Music, [ReVanced Team](https://github.com/ReVanced) for reviving Vanced with YT and YT Music, and [Inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00) for improving ReVanced by adding valuable features to YT and YT Music.

You deserve more recognition.

# <p align="center"> Warning ! 

Attention: Inotia00 does NOT share any patched applications, nor does he recommend downloading pre-patched apps from third-party sites. I also do not recommend it, as such apps may contain malicious code. The only safe solution is to use [RV/X Manager](https://github.com/Kevinr99089/Extended.Builder/blob/main/install.md#for-installing-with-revanced-manager-please-follow-this-tutorial) or [ReVancify](https://github.com/Kevinr99089/Extended.Builder/blob/main/install.md#for-installing-with-revancify-please-follow-this-tutorial). No site is 100% safe.

# <p align="center"> So why am I using this repository?

Let me be clear: This repository (and similar ones) are not tolerated by Inotia00 due to [DMCA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) reasons. I opened it for personal use. If Inotia00 sees this message, I'd like to apologize for using this type of solutionâ€”it's for simplicity and automation. I can delete this repository if requested, but please note that I do not promote it, nor do I use it to share apps or include malicious code.
